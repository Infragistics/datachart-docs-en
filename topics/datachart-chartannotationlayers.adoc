= Chart Annotation Layers

== Topic Overview

=== Purpose

This topic provides conceptual information about the annotations and hover interactions available on the link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}.html[{DataChartName}™] control including the different types of hover interaction layers available. These layers are not supported by the following chart series:

* Scatter
* Polar
* Radial
* Stacked

=== Required background

The following topics are prerequisites to understanding this topic:

| link:datachart-getting-started-with-datachart.html[Getting Started with Data Chart]
|The _{DataChartName}_ control requires a data object model to be mapped to control's DataContext property. This article will provide a simple data object model but you can create your own and use it with this sample code instead.

| link:datachart-category-series-overview.html[Category Series]
|This topic explains various types of Category Series in the _{DataChartName}_ control.

[[Overview]]
== Overview

=== Hover interactions summary

Hover interactions are implemented through hover interaction layers which are series that are added to the series collection. These layers are dependent on the cursor position. Adding the hover interaction layers to the  _xamDataC_  _hart_  control disables the default behavior of the crosshairs and/or tooltips (depending on which type of layer added).

The default behavior is disabled because it prevents visual confusion as the hover interaction layers perform a similar visual function compared to the built in behavior as the cursor moves. You can, however, override this behavior and allow the default crosshair functionality to perform in addition to the hover interaction layer functionality. Also of note, only target a series by one tooltip layer at a time. If you target more than one tooltip layer at a series, the hover interaction layers that use tooltips will not function as expected. This is due to the fact that series tooltips are `UIElements` and can only be attached to the visual tree in one place at a time. Using a tooltip for a series in more than one location at once is not allowed.

The following screenshot displays the  _{DataChartName}_  control with the category highlight layer, the crosshair layer and the item tooltip layer implemented.

[[CommonProperties]]
== Common Properties

=== Common properties and methods overview

Since the hover interaction layers inherit from the link:{DataChartLink}.series_members.html[Series] object, they gain a lot of the properties and methods that are available on the link:{DataChartLink}.series_members.html[Series] base class. However, not everything from the link:{DataChartLink}.series_members.html[Series] class is meaningful for the hover interaction layers. For example, hover interaction layers are not designed to interact with the mouse and should not be hit testable; consequently they will not raise mouse related events.

For more information on the common properties and methods, see the link:datachart-commonproperties.html[Common Properties] topic.

[[TypesofLayers]]
== Types of Layers

=== Introduction

Currently there are 5 different hover interaction layers available on the  _{DataChartName}_  control. Each of these hover interactions layers provides a different highlight, hover and tooltip interactions that may be used individually or combined with one another providing powerful hover interactions.

=== Types of Layers

The following table summarizes the different types of layers available on the  _{DataChartName}_  control.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Layer Type|Description

|[[CrosshairLayer]] 

link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer_members.html[CrosshairLayer]
|The link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer_members.html[CrosshairLayer] provides crossing lines that meet at the actual value of every targeted series.

For more information, see the link:datachart-crosshairlayer.html[Crosshair Layer] topic.

|[[CategoryHighlightLayer]] 

link:{DataChartLink}.categoryhighlightlayer_members.html[CategoryHighlightLayer]
|The link:{DataChartLink}.categoryhighlightlayer_members.html[CategoryHighlightLayer] targets a category axis, or all category axes in the _{DataChartName}_ control. They draw a shape that illuminates the area of the axis closest to the cursor position. 

image::images/Hover_InteractionsOverview_3.png[] 

For more information, see the link:datachart-categoryhighlightlayer.html[Category Highlight Layer] topic.

|[[CategoryItemHighlightLayer]] 

link:{DataChartLink}.categoryitemhighlightlayer_members.html[CategoryItemHighlightLayer]
|The link:{DataChartLink}.categoryitemhighlightlayer_members.html[CategoryItemHighlightLayer] layer highlights items in a series that use a category axis either by drawing a banded shape at their position or by rendering a marker at their position. 

image::images/Hover_InteractionsOverview_4.png[] 

For more information, see the link:datachart-categoryitemhighlightlayer.html[Category Item Highlight Layer] topic.

|[[CategoryToolTipLayer]] 

link:{DataChartLink}.categorytooltiplayer_members.html[CategoryToolTipLayer]
|The link:{DataChartLink}.categorytooltiplayer_members.html[CategoryToolTipLayer] displays grouped tooltips for series using a category axis. 

image::images/Hover_InteractionsOverview_5.png[] 

For more information, see the link:datachart-categorytooltiplayer.html[Category Tooltip Layer] topic.

|[[ItemToolTipLayer]] 

link:{DataChartLink}.itemtooltiplayer_members.html[ItemToolTipLayer]
|The link:{DataChartLink}.itemtooltiplayer_members.html[ItemToolTipLayer] displays tooltips for all target series individually.
