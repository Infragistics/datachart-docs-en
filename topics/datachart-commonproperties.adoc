= Common Properties

== Topic Overview

=== Purpose

This topic provides information about the properties and methods that the hover interaction feature uses for highlighting, hovering and interacting with the tooltip interactions inherited from the link:{DataChartLink}.series_members.html[Series] class.

=== Required background

The following topics are prerequisites to understanding this topic:

|Topic|Purpose

| link:datachart-getting-started-with-datachart.html[Getting Started with {DataChartName}]
|The _{DataChartName}_ control requires a data object model to be mapped to control's DataContext property. This article will provide a simple data object model but you can create your own and use it with this sample code instead.

| link:datachart-category-series-overview.html[Category Series]
|This topic explains various types of Category Series in the _{DataChartName}_ control.

[[Overview]]
== Overview

=== Common properties overview

The hover interactions layers inherit those link:{DataChartLink}.series_members.html[Series] base class properties and methods that are relevant in the context of hover interactions. For example, hover interactions, by design do not interact with the mouse, so they do not raise the mouse events. Also, the hover interaction layers do not display data directly, so methods such as link:{DataChartLink}.series~scrollintoview.html[ScrollIntoView] are not applicable for this feature.

== Common Properties

=== Common Items summary

The following table summarizes the link:{DataChartLink}.series_members.html[Series] class properties inherited by the hover interaction classes.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|Property Name|Property Type|Description

| link:{DataChartLink}.series{ApiProp}brush.html[Brush]
|`Brush`
|The hover interaction layers inherit their link:{DataChartLink}.series{ApiProp}brush.html[Brush] from the series with whom they are interacting. However, this can be overridden by setting the link:{DataChartLink}.series{ApiProp}brush.html[Brush] property directly.

| link:{DataChartLink}.series{ApiProp}outline.html[Outline]
|`Brush`
|This property follows the same guidelines as the link:{DataChartLink}.series{ApiProp}brush.html[Brush] property, listed above.

| link:{DataChartLink}.annotationlayer{ApiProp}cursorposition.html[CursorPosition]
|`Point`
|This property specifies the world position to use instead of the default mouse position (NaN, NaN). When this property is set, it fixes the particular layer on the provided world position. 

.Note: 

[NOTE] 

==== 

A world position contains x and y values which range from 0 to 1 representing the global position of the cursor relative to the entire ranges of the axes. 

====

ifdef::xaml,win-forms[]
| link:{DataChartLink}.series{ApiProp}isdefaultcrosshairbehaviordisabled.html[IsDefaultCrosshairBehaviorDisabled]
|`bool`
|This property specifies if the series default crosshair should be disabled when there is a hover interactions layer on the chart. The default value is True.
endif::xaml,win-forms[]

| link:{DataChartLink}.annotationlayer{ApiProp}useindex.html[UseIndex]
|`bool`
|This property specifies if the hover interactions layer should use a series index and reserve a color in the Brushes collection that is assigned to the {DataChartName} control. The default value is False.

| link:{DataChartLink}.annotationlayer{ApiProp}uselegend.html[UseLegend]
|`bool`
|This property specifies if the hover interactions layer should appear in the legend. When this property is set to true, it also indexes the series as it is required to appear in the legend. In order be recognized in the ledgend you must assign a single color to the series. The default value is False.

== Setting the Inherited Properties on a Crosshair Layer

=== Example

The following screenshot illustrates how the  _{DataChartName}_   control’s link:{DataChartLink}.crosshairlayer.html[CrosshairLayer] looks using the following settings:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Property|Value

| link:{DataChartLink}.annotationlayer{ApiProp}cursorposition.html[CursorPosition]
|0.55, 0.55

| link:{DataChartLink}.annotationlayer{ApiProp}uselegend.html[UseLegend]
|True
