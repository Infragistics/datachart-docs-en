|Chart Element|Descrption

| link:{DataChartLink}.{DataChartName}.html[{DataChartName}]
|The _{DataChartName}_ is a control that supports various types of data visualizations which are called Series objects. The chart control can contain multiple visualizations of your data in the same chart plot area.

| link:{DataChartLink}.series.html[Series]
|The Series objects provide actual visualization of your data. The chart support different types of Series and all types of series are listed in the link:datachart-series-types.html[Series Types] topic. Each type of series can plot data that meets certain data requirements (such as number of data column and their types) as well as what type of axis can be used with it. Refer to the link:datachart-series-requirements.html[Series Requirements] topic for requirements for each of the series.

| link:{DataChartLink}.axis.html[Axis]
|The Axis objects provide context and information about range of data in a form of labels, numbers, tickmarks, gridlines, stips, and titles. The chart support different types of Axis objects which can be used only with certain types of Series. Refer to the link:datachart-axes.html[Chart Axes] topic for more information about types of axis supported by the chart control.

=== Selecting Chart

Based on type of your data, you need to choose which type of series you want to use in the chart control. Some types of series offer support only for certain types of axis. Therefore, you also need to select valid axes that work with selected series.

The following flow chart explains the process of selecting series and axes based on data that you wish to plot in the chart control.
