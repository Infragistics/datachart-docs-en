== Introduction

Category Series is a group of the simplest and most common form of chart series that take data and render it as collection of data points stretched along a horizontal line (e.g. column series) or vertical line (e.g. bar series).

== Types of Category Series

The {DataChartName} control supports the following types of Category Series and each of them is discussed in an individual topic:

These topics will provide you with useful information on how to use create a specific type of Category Series and bind data to it.

ifdef::sl,wpf,win-universal,win-phone[]
Also, you can create your own types of series by following instructions in the link:datachart-creating-custom-series.html[Creating Custom Series] topic.
endif::sl,wpf,win-universal,win-phone[]

You can also use multiple types of Category Series with link:datachart-series-financial-price-series-overview.html[Financial Series] or link:datachart-financial-indicators-overview.html[Financial Indicators] to create complex charts visuals. Refer to the link:datachart-multiple-series.html[Adding Multiple Series] and link:datachart-multiple-axes.html[Using Multiple Axes] topics for more information on this feature of the {DataChartName} control.

Each linked topic demonstrates, with code examples, how to create a specific type of Category Series and bind data to it.

== Supported Axes

There are various types of axes in the {DataChartName} control, but only certain types of axes can be used with specific types of Category Series. In addition, each of Category Series must have binding set to one x-axis and one y-axis using the series object’s XAxis and YAxis properties. Refer to the Series Requirements topic for a list of axes supported by different types of Category Series. For more information on axes refer to the Axes topic.

== Data Binding

This section provides information about binding data for all types of Category Series from data requirements through data sample to binding diagrams.

== Data Requirements

Similarly to other types of series in the {DataChartName} control, Category Series also use  pick:[sl,wpf,win-phone,win-universal,xamarin=" link:{ApiPlatform}{DataChartAssembly}{ApiVersion}{DataChartNamespace}.series~itemssource.html[ItemsSource]"]  pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}{DataChartAssembly}{ApiVersion}{DataChartNamespace}.series~datasource.html[DataSource]"]  property to bind data. All series can be bound to any object that implements the link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[IEnumerable] link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[interface (e.g.] link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sh2ey19.aspx[List] link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[,] link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132397.aspx[Collection] link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[,] link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7977ey2c.aspx[Queue] link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx[,] link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.stack.aspx[Stack]), however, in case of Category Series, each item in this object must have at least one numeric data column which is mapped using the ValueMemberPath property of the series and one category data column which is mapped to the Label property of the category axis (e.g. CategoryXAxis). For more information on the requirements for the specific types of series, refer to the Series Requirements topic.

== Data Sample

An example of object that meets above criteria is the link:resources-sample-category-data.html[Sample Category Data] which you can download from the Category Data Sample resource and use it in your project.

== Binding Diagrams

The type of Category Series determines how the {DataChartName} control is bound to data and what axes will be used. Table 2 lists the types of Category Series and shows diagrams with bindings between data, axes and series.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
Some of Category Series are the same in terms of binding data and they are listed together.
