=== Overview

The SaveTo method of the UltraDataChart can be used to render the chart’s image to a file or a stream.

[[_Ref429040869]]

=== Code Example

The following are code snippets demonstrating how to use the SaveTo functionality of the  _UltraDataChart._

To save to a file, a path and an image format need to be specified. The following line of code saves the chart to a JPEG image file:

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
this.ultraDataChart1.SaveTo(“chart.jpeg”, System.Drawming.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg);
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Me.UltraDataChart1.SaveTo(“chart.jpeg”, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg)
----

The chart's binary image data can also be saved to a stream. In this case, the stream and the image format must be specified:

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
this.ultraDataChart1.SaveTo(stream, System.Drawming.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg);
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Me.UltraDataChart1.SaveTo(stream, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg)
----
